## PROJECTS
### [Brain Stroke Prediction WebApp](https://github.com/Dhilshan2000/Brain-Stroke-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-with-Flask-and-Python.git)
- This project is a Flask-based web application designed to predict the likelihood of a stroke in individuals using
  machine learning.
- The model uses various health-related inputs such as age, gender, blood glucose level, BMI, and lifestyle
  factors like smoking status and work type to predict stroke risk.
- The WebApp displays whether the user is "Likely" or "Not Likely" to have a stroke.
- The project showcases proficiency in Machine Learning, Frontend Development, and Backend Processing,
  delivering an innovative solution for predicting stroke with a 95% accuracy.
#### Tech stack :
- Flask, Bootstrap, Pandas, NumPy, ML Models, Joblib, HTML/CSS


### [Multiple Disease Prediction WebApp](https://github.com/Dhilshan2000/Multiple-Disease-Prediction-WebApp-System-with-Streamlit-and-Python.git)
- This project is a Multiple Disease Prediction System built using Python, Streamlit, and Machine Learning
  models. It provides an easy-to-use web interface for predicting the likelihood of three different diseases:
  Diabetes : 77% Accuracy , Heart Disease : 82% Accuracy & Parkinson's Disease : 88% Accuracy.
- Provided a valuable tool for individuals to assess their risk of three major diseases based on health data.
- Enabled easy deployment and accessibility of the disease prediction models through a web application
  interface.
- The project showcases proficiency in Machine Learning, Frontend Development, and Backend Processing,
  delivering an innovative solution for predicting stroke.
#### Tech stack :
- Streamlit, Pickle, Pandas, NumPy, ML Models


### [Fruits and Vegetables Image Recognition WebApp](https://github.com/Dhilshan2000/Fruits-and-Vegetables-Image-Recognition.git)
- Developed an image classification system to recognize different fruits and vegetables using a deep learning
  model built with TensorFlow, integrated with a user-friendly web interface built using Streamlit.
- The model processes the uploaded image, performs inference, and predicts the most likely category (fruit or
  vegetable) using image pre-processing and classification with a 79% Accuracy.
- Developed an interactive web application using Streamlit, where users can upload images and get predictions
  for the type of fruit or vegetable.
#### Tech stack :
- Streamlit, Streamlit, .H5, NumPy, ML Models
